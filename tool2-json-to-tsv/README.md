# Tool 2 – FPS Result Processing (JSON → TSV)

## Purpose
Batch-processes FPS JSON files generated by CapFrameX and converts them into Excel-compatible TSV files for easy analysis and reporting.

## Workflow
1. CapFrameX generates FPS data as JSON files  
2. The tool batch-processes all JSON files in the specified directory  
3. FPS metrics are calculated automatically  
4. Results are exported as TSV and TXT files  

## Input
- CapFrameX-generated FPS JSON files

## Output
- **TSV file** containing calculated FPS metrics (Excel-compatible)
- **TXT file** containing the same processed results

Both output files are saved to the same directory as the input JSON files.

## Usage Steps

1. Create a folder named `current` under **Documents**
2. Copy all generated CapFrameX JSON files into:
3. Copy `fps.exe` to the **Documents** folder
4. Double-click `fps.exe` to run the tool
5. The tool will process all JSON files in the `current` folder
6. Two output files will be generated:
- `.TSV`
- `.TXT`
7. Both output files will be saved to:
8. Copy the `.TSV` file into the Excel file of your choice for further analysis

## Design Note
TSV output is used because not all test units have a valid or active Excel installation.

## Notes
- Designed to work seamlessly with **Tool 1 – Automated Benchmark Trigger**
- Supports batch processing for large numbers of benchmark runs
- No additional installation is required beyond the executable
