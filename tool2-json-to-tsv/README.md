# Tool 2 – FPS Result Processing (JSON → TSV)

## Purpose
Batch-processes FPS JSON files generated by CapFrameX and converts them into Excel-compatible TSV files.

## Input
- CapFrameX JSON output directory

## Output
- TSV file containing calculated FPS metrics

## Design Note
TSV output is used because not all test units have an active Excel license.
